Creating automation programs that will be helpful in research endeavours

# 1. SurveyTool.py
This tool is very useful in quantitative research without the need to tally all the survey responses by hand.
It first inquires how many respondent, and began asking for their ratings in Likert scale i.e. (5 for strongly agree, 1 for strongly disagree, you get the idea!)
NOTE: This has to be done per item

It, however, still needs human input, but it is a time-saver by cutting the time calculating the percentages, the ranks, and the mean providing instant results! Making your research more productive!

I'll be trying to work on reducing human input by using neural network and AI and it'll probably be challenging (y'know just like how Google image works)

Sample results:
```
Statement: [insert] Response       %      Rank
5                   8              26.7   2
4                   9              30.0   1
3                   5              16.7   3
2                   5              16.7   3
1                   3              10.0   4

Mean(average): 3.5
```
This had been done by my 10th Grade self and is probably the nerdiest thing I've done among any others

### Future plans:
- Add the functionality to be able to edit missed numbers
- Make a GUI 
- Add other statistical tools
- Integrate AI for analyzing data
- Fix some bugs

# 2. ThatOneWebsite.py
The exact idea I've been thinking. Just made it a while ago. Pretty spaghetti and in beta state, but I'm going to launch it. 


Basically, it will go through your browser history which may or may not came from a browser extension. The extension being: Quick Chrome History Export. 
It is pretty helpful in the Review of Related Literature chapter of your research paper when you just seem to lose that one source in the stack of other websites.

Just did it for about 2 hours and me just smashing with my research in Google.
I'll try to make it as neat as possible in the next developments with good GUI, and make it more accessible. 
I'll also incorporate csv module.
